My research is primarily centered around those key areas: **Compressed Sensing**, **Deep Learning**, **Smart Industrial** and **Intelligent Communication System for Aircraft**.



## Compressed Sensing

For compressed sensing, my recent interest is to develop perturbed compressed sensing theory, which not only consider the measurement noise but also take the noise of the sensing matrix into account. [Learn more](https://dwgan.top/blog/)


## Deep Learning

For deep learning, I am deeply passionate about advancing the capabilities of neural networks through innovative models for vision tasks.

I am currently focused on exploring new models, such as Mamba, to replace traditional Transformer-based architectures. My goal is to achieve more efficient representation and reduced complexity in neural networks. My research particularly targets vision tasks like image compressed sensing, where the objective is to recover higher quality images using fewer samples, requiring enhanced expressive power in neural networks.

## Smart Industrial

For Smart Industrial, I am focusing on develop the ecosystem of smart home/industrial technologies using ST microchips.

As a System Application Engineer at ST, I specialize in smart industrial applications for smart homes, with a primary focus on advancing the ecosystem. One key area of our work is promoting the KNX standard, a leading international protocol in smart home automation that ensures seamless compatibility and plug-and-play functionality across devices. We’ve developed various demos to showcase the integration of ST’s products, such as STM32 MCU/MPU, chips, KNX protocol chips, IO-Link protocol chips, edge AI sensors, DC-DC converters, and energy harvesting chips. Our demos include smart charging stations, mini IoT houses, photovoltaic energy storage and harvesting, IoT sensors, KNX-based smart building management systems, and solutions for remote network monitoring and intranet penetration.

## Intelligent Communication System for Aircraft

For Wireless Communication, I am focusing on develop the communication devices used for wireless data, instruction transmission inside the cabin of rocket.

Since 2020 to 2023, I was participated in some project that provided aerospace devices for Commercial Aerospace Company like [Beijing Skywalk Technology Co., Ltd.](http://www.spacetransportation.com.cn/) During this period, I was able to design high-reliable hardware and software for aerospace devices as well as solve some problem using wireless communication. I learned how to solve those hard problems in aerospace devices using a systems engineering mindset.

Aim to empowering the next generation of intelligent aircraft communication systems, we addresses challenges in the application of new technologies, leveraging existing industrial technologies for low-cost, rapid iteration of aircraft devices. My primary focus is on in-cabin wireless communication, wireless power transfer, and onboard central computer for rocket.

Utilizing ultra wide band (UWB) wireless communication technology, we solve some wireless communication challenges including high-rate transmission (camera data), time-sensitive transmission (synchronous data), high-reliable transmission (instruction data) and wireless networking (hard to realize by wire communication). We also solve problem of wireless power and proposed unified core communication framework for missile-borne computer.

All devices are verified through aerospace experiment and flight missions. Here is the [report link](https://www.guancha.cn/industry-science/2022_01_24_623388.shtml) about one of flight missions.
