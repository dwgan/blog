Hi there. Welcome to my blog. This blog contains some topic that I recently interested in, including **Deep Learning**, and **Internet of Thing**.

You are also welcome to visit my [**CSDN Blog**](https://dwgan.blog.csdn.net/), which is about **Embedded Development**  and **Compressed Sensing**.

## [Deep Learning]()

In recent years, deep learning technology have dramatically change the world. The rapid rise of ChatGPT has changed how people solve problems and strengthened the positive view of artificial intelligence. This change has brought a lot of investment into the field, attracting more researchers to AI. New technologies are appearing every month, increasing competition in the industry. As a result, professionals need to keep updating their skills to avoid falling behind.

Since I have experience on Image Compressed Sensing, I turned my interest to Deep Image Processing. I am recently interested in newest model that can perform Efficient Representation and Low Complexity. I have kept updating newest model that recent proposed, like [Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752), [KAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19756) etc.

### [Deep Compressed Sensing]()

To optimize the information representation efficiency, we explore the newest space state model and employ it to image representation.



### [**Super Server Platform**](https://dwgan.github.io/super-server-platform/)

To maximize the efficient usage of GPUs, I built a Super Server Platform for multiple online user, which is based on **Linux Container**.\

## [Smart Industrial]()

As a System Application Engineer at ST, my recent work mainly focus on Smart Home / Building Automation. Our mission is design more system solution for customers using our ST's products including MCUs (e.g. STM32 serials), converters (e.g. DC-DC, signal converter). One of serials that we recently focus on is STKNX. KNX is a international standard protocol in smart home automation field, which provides a full standard from physical layer to application layer. The full standard allow easy use without considering the compatibility of the products, realizing plug and play.

Here are some topics that I recently focus on

### [STM32MP1](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32mp1-series.html)

### [**STKNX Charging Station**](https://github.com/dwgan/STKNX_ChargeStation)

Nowadays, EV car are more and more popular, but the number of EV charge station is under development. One of the most serious reason is that different suppliers of EV chargers are not able to put together in a system since different suppliers own their own private protocol. 

We introduce KNX into the system, which allow different EV charger from different suppliers exchange data if they use KNX protocol. This platforms  will help to have more EV chargers more long term in terms of sustainability because in a system integrators will not care about the the supplier of EV charger, but they are just they just need to be concerned that the EV charger is compliant to can existing standard. And today existing standard already have all this available to be deployed for energy management system and in particular EV chargers that will help again the deployment of more EV.

### [**NAT traversal**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-06-26-How-to-enploy-NAT-traversa-on-Synology %})

In order to realize smart home / building automation, including remote control and data storage, we employ a Synology based data center.
